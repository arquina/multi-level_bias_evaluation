# Multi-Level Evaluation Reveals Heterogeneous Bias in Pathology Foundation Models


Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs) are rapidly transforming digital pathology; however, how different models capture or exhibit technical biases has not been systematically characterized. In particular, it remains unclear which specific slides, staining patterns, or tissue regions drive these biases, and whether they arise uniformly across a model. In this study, a multi-level evaluation pipeline was developed to systematically characterize the center bias in PFMs by integrating cohort-, slide-, and patch-level analyses. Within this pipeline, the Slide-wise Distribution Difference (SDD) and Patch-wise Distance Difference (PDD) are introduced to quantify the slide- and patch-level biases by comparing the patch-to-prototype distance distributions across centers. Applying this framework to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and a controlled multi-center in-house dataset, it was observed that PFMs still exhibited center bias with variability across models. Slide-level analysis revealed heterogeneity in center bias across samples, and patch-level analysis further identified tissue regions associated with elevated center bias. Together, these results demonstrate that the center bias in PFMs is heterogeneous and spatially localized, and that our pipeline enables the systematic evaluation of bias across multiple representation levels.
